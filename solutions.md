- GitLab is a Git repository manager with built-in CI/CD and DevOps tools, offering both cloud and self-hosted options.



## Question 3
### -Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS)
1. Mercurial (Hg) Similar to Git, known for simplicity and performance.
2. Bazaar Flexible and user-friendly, developed by Canonical (Ubuntu's parent company).
3. Fossil Includes issue tracking and wiki features, used by SQLite.
### -Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS)
1. Apache Subversion (SVN) A widely used, older version control system.
2. Perforce (Helix Core) Used in enterprise environments, especially in gaming and large software projects.
3. IBM Rational ClearCase Enterprise-grade, used for large-scale software development.
4. CVS (Concurrent Versions System) One of the earliest VCS, now mostly obsolete.



## Question 4
The git status command shows the current state of your working directory and staging area.

 It helps you see which files have been modified, staged, or remain untracked before committing changes.




 ## Question 5
 In Git, a commit is a fundamental concept that represents a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time. 
 
 When you make a commit, Git saves the state of your project,
 
including all tracked files, and assigns a unique identifier (a commit hash) to this snapshot.

This allows you to track changes, collaborate with other developers, and revert to previous versions if needed.
